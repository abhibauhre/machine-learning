## 🔍 Overview

This repository documents my complete Machine Learning learning path, built from a structured course that covers fundamentals, algorithms, projects, and deployment. I follow a daily learning-in-public approach: I study, implement, and push small, meaningful code each day.

This README maps exactly to the course modules I am following (NumPy, Pandas, Visualization, Regression, Classification, Clustering, PCA, Model Deployment, and more), lists required libraries, explains folder structure, provides a step-by-step study & coding plan, and adds a psychological approach to keep consistency and build trust.

## 🛠️ Libraries & Tools (what I will use)

**Python version:** 3.8+

**Core libraries**

* `numpy` — array operations and linear algebra
* `pandas` — data manipulation & preprocessing
* `matplotlib` — plotting basics
* `seaborn` — statistical visualization
* `scikit-learn` — ML algorithms, model selection, preprocessing
* `joblib` — model save/load
* `scipy` — scientific computations (when needed)

**Optional / advanced**

* `xgboost` / `lightgbm` — boosting methods for tabular data
* `tensorflow` / `torch` — basic deep learning later
* `nltk` / `spacy` — basic NLP for Naive Bayes module
* `umap-learn` / `plotly` — extra visualization & dimensionality tools

**Deployment & dev tools**

* `flask` or `fastapi` — simple model serving
* `gunicorn` — production server
* `docker` — containerization (optional)
* `jupyter` / `jupyterlab` — notebooks

**Environment management**

* `pip` or `conda`
* `requirements.txt` (I will add one per project)

---

## 🧭 Step-by-step Plan (module → code → commit)

For each module I will follow this exact workflow:

1. **Watch / Read** the module lectures & take written notes in `00_notes/`.
2. **Small implementation**: follow a toy example (Jupyter notebook) to reproduce concepts.
3. **Project/Exercise**: apply concept on a small dataset (clean, train, evaluate).
4. **Refactor & Modularize**: move working code to `scripts/` as reusable functions.
5. **Document**: Update README or module-level `README.md` summarizing findings.
6. **Commit & Push**: create multiple meaningful commits per day (e.g., `feat: add linear regression notebook`, `docs: add lr summary`, `refactor: extract preprocessing function`).

**Time guidance per module (approx)**

* Small modules (NumPy, Matplotlib): 1–2 days each
* Medium algorithms (Linear Regression, Logistic): 2–4 days each
* Larger modules (RandomForest, Boosting, Capstone): 4–7 days each

> These are flexible. The important part is daily progress and quality commits.

## 📈 Progress Tracker (how I will show growth)

* Daily commits with short logs in `00_notes/daily_log.md` (date + 3-line summary)
* Module-level `README.md` describing tasks done and pending
* Summary badges & a weekly status table (I will update each Sunday)

## 🧠 Psychology & Discipline Section (why I do this)

Learning ML is a long game — technical skills are only half the battle. The other half is mindset.

**My psychological rules to stay consistent:**

1. **Progress > Perfection** — small steps every day beat occasional bursts.
2. **Public accountability** — pushing code publicly strengthens commitment and builds trust.
3. **Reflect daily** — write a 2–3 line note about what you learned and one action for tomorrow.
4. **Celebrate micro-wins** — finished a notebook? Commit + add a one-line trophy in `daily_log.md`.
5. **Tolerance for failure** — models will fail. Treat failure as data for your learning process.

## 🔧 How to run examples (common commands)

Create environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a notebook (locally):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Run a training script:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/linear_reg.yaml
```

Save model example (inside script):

```python
from joblib import dump
dump(model, 'models/linear_reg.joblib')
```

## 📌 Notes & Next Steps (what I will add soon)

* Weekly status table with badges (progress %, modules completed)
* Small visuals/screenshots for major projects
* Short demo notebooks converted into `.py` scripts for reproducibility
